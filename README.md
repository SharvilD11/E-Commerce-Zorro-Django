# SOC Project Name : Making an E-Commerce Website using Django
I was working on this project for nearly 3 months starting from April end. In the initial phase when the project started, mentor wa giving us weekly materials like in the first week he gave material for HTML, CSS, then in the subsequent week Bootstrap, then Python and then finally Django.

The first half of the project where we had to make the website using only frontend was completed on time which was mid May but later on we didn't have any deadline uptil now so I kept postponing the project work and also we were called back to campus in May and then we had our mid-sems, then end-sems so didn't actually get much time to work on this project until the vacations started.

Coming to the description of all the files that I have created in this project.

Zorro : It is the project created initially and is also the name of my E-Commerce Website app : It is the app created inside this project(python apps) static : This folder contains all the images that I have used in my Website templates : This contains all the html files that I coded. I used some amount of javascript too but didn't separate the javascript files so sorry for that.

# individual template files:
1. appplepro.html : contains product information
2. base.html : base file of my project which contains code needed on every web page of my website.
3. checkout.html : checkout page
4. children.html : contains products
5. deals.html : contains products having offers on them
6. electronics.html : contains electronic products like mobiles,laptops
7. email.html :
8. fashion.html : contains clothe=ing products
9. iPhone13.html : contains product infromation
10. index.html : index page of my website. I have added signin,signup,tracker functionalities and many more in the project.
11. men.html : contains products
12. sonybravia.html : contains product infromation
13. tracker.html : Tracker which can give updates about order whenever someone enters their order id and email
14. women.html : contains products
# I have added products, orders and order-updates in the django admin interface which you can see by logging in
# username - admin
# password - admin
THERE ARE SOME BUGS IN THE PROJECT WHICH I DIDN'T FIX OR RATHER DIDN"T HAVE TIME TO FIX LIKE THE ADD TO CART BUG For now I can add products from only one of the web pages at a time while ordering. So, if someone is reading this and is gonna test my project please use the add to cart function on deals page since it has the most number of products on my website. Also, you can see the cart in checkout page

# For Sign-in and Sign-up
 1. I haven't added the registered successfully alert on signing up but if you enter all the information you get signep up on the website and you can see it in django admin
2. to log in you need to enter the name that you used while signing up and the password
